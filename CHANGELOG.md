# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-stubs` will be documented in this file

## v1.0.0 - 2022-03-29

First release.

It's just a little bit more opinionated than that Spatie version. I've renamed the Artisan command (so not to be confused with their version). The following changes have been made to all the stubs:

- Added `declare(strict_types=1);` to the top of ALL the stubs
- Updated a few return types

## 1.0.0 - 2022-03-29

- Initial release
